# EventCounter

This app is about creating an event counter that counts up from the event date. Once you input the event date, it will tell you how many days or months 
are left until your next yearly/monthly anniversary date and also how much time has passed since the event.

This is a web app on express. I am using MongoDB, bootstrap4, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and EJS templating system. App also has a user auth that I yet have to implement.
